[Alpine Linux](http://www.alpinelinux.org/) for Docker
============

This is a minimum viable Alpine image: only alpine-keys
installed (to allow for signed package installing using
`/sbin/apk.static`).

The repository cache has been updated (with one mirror).

You will have to install busybox-static, busybox, 
alpine-baselayout, or alpine-base if you want a shell
(in order of size).
